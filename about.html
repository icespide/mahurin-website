                <p>
A civil servant, father and husband, Jerrod Mahurin is the Elected Prosecutor of St. Francois County, Missouri.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike most, Jerrod knew before kindergarten what he wanted to be when he grew up, an attorney.  His career choice has never waivered and neither has his desire to serve others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jerrod has been a lifelong resident of St. Francois County. His father, Butch Mahurin, is a retired Marine and IBEW union worker and his mother, Bonita Mahurin, is a retired Southwestern Bell Employee and CWA union worker.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jerrod is a North County graduate and Member of their Hall of Fame. Jerrod continued his education and graduated from Oklahoma City University Law School. He currently lives in Park Hills with his wife, Laura, a special education teacher, and their twelve-year-old son, Lukas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jerrod has worked in the St. Francois County Prosecutor’s Office for almost a decade and is truly honored to continue to represent its citizens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He values his profession with high-esteem. Whether it is prosecuting bad checks, robberies, or murders, he believes every victim deserves caring and compassionate representation along with the ability to try to be made whole after someone has victimized them. Jerrod believes the most important thing that you can do is listen to a victim.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jerrod is an exceptional trial attorney. Over the last decade he has obtained a life sentence or greater conviction in 13 out of 14 murder 1 cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jerrod has a conviction rate of over 97% in trial cases whereas the state average is under 90%. This ranks our county as having one of the highest conviction rates in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jerrod has taught classes at both the Law Enforcement Academy and Mineral Area College. He is a member of the First Baptist Church in Desloge, Mineral Area Elks Lodge, Democratic Club, Masonic Lodge and Local Bar. He is a Backstopper Member, supporter, and he has served on the board.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout his service, he has been humbled with the 2013 St. Francois County “Citizen of the Year” award and he was a first time recipient of the 2016 “Law Enforcement Appreciation Award” that was given for outstanding and dedicated service to the criminal justice system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jerrod looks forward to continuing to serve the citizens of this county and work with law enforcement to make our neighborhoods safe, all while upholding the laws that this great nation was founded upon.  He has spent almost his entire career serving the people of St. Francois County and representing victims.
